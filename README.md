> ⚠️ **Note:** I made this primarily for myself, so it might not work correctly on other PCs. I am a beginner, some of the code might be a bit messy, not all new features have been fully tested, and AI tools were used for assistance.

### How to compile
- For beginner: Fork this repo, push any change, and GitHub Actions will automatically put the .exe in `Releases` (takes ~2 minutes).
- For veteran: You should know how to compile already.
